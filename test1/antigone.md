##  Sophocles' Antigone

- Heamon and Antigone are betrothed, but she is never married
  - never crosses into womenhood
  - when a woman marries she abandons her family and joins another
- This play is about being in grief
  - never moves on and never becomes Heamon's wife
- Rejects Heamon's love as well as Ismene's
- both plays are about being too certain in what you believe in
  - Oedipus believed bc he left his parents are he could not kill his mother and marry his mother
  - Creon bc he believes he is right about not burying Polynices
    - his people and the daughters believed that he was wrong

#### Orthodox View 

- who is right, and who is wrong?
- Antigone is right, Creon is wrong
- she is seen as a Christian martyr and a strong woman
- Philoi means friends, she is looking for friend
  - Creon's friends are those who are devoted to the city
  - Antigone's friends are her kin
- concerned with the world below
- she is choosing her own death (rejects Creon's punishment)
- Why do Greek women hang themselves?
  - making a political statement about a woman's voice and how it is not heard

#### Hegelian View

- Hegel is a German philosopher
- Antigone and Creon are equally right and wrong
- both the state and the family should be obeyed
- a woman is supposed to exhibit sophrosyne with is shown by Ismene
- Thesis = Antigone representing the old family order
- antithesis = Creon representing the state
- synthesis = family and state in a new order of thing that integrated and respects demands of both

#### Zina's View

- characters are in conflict with themselves and with others
- Interpersonal Conflict
  - be able to use one conflict as an example (canvas for lines)
- Intra-personal Conflict
  - be able to use one conflict as an example (canvas for lines)
  - Ismene changing her stance about supporting Antigone
  - Creon wanting to save Antigone after sealing her away
    - doesn't abide by his own proclamation, says he is going to do a public stoning, ends up sealing her away in a tomb
  - Inconsistency with yourself
    - goes to death in a state of ambivalence
    - unclear whether she is dying happily, embracing the cause, or if she is suffering
  - Antigone, triumphant vs. miserable

## Anouilh's "Antigone"

- The two brothers are given attention
- Religion is treated very different from Sophocles
  - Creon makes very light of religion
- Unclear as to why she is dying
- meta-theater - they know that they are in a 
  - aware of the role that you are playing in the play
  - modern element in theater
  - allusion to the political situation in Nazi occupied France
  - constructing a world where everyone in it is enacting the directions of someone else
  - fate and metatheater have the same function
    - fate is also like a script
  - the script that Creon enacts is to not bury the traitor
    - authority figure proclaiming what they need to do
- antigone symbolically buries her brother by sprinkling dust on him
- buries him with a spade
- Antigone is associated with childhood
- Creon says that 'a child must have buried him', calling them foolish
- Creon is doing his duty as the King
  - he is executing orders
  - Antigone needs to be a wife and a mother
  - man of practice, wants to get things done
  - pragmatist
- Antigone is looking for meaning, individual contribution to the world
  - idealist, who does not want to compromise
- dehumanization by referring to people as animals
- when feeling oppressed, what do they do?
  - either conform or rebl
- Antigone's death
  - "idk anymore what i'm dying for, i'm afraid"
