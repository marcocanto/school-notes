### Seneca's Oedipus

- Manto was no tin the other play, is used as the eye as the Tiresias
- Phorbas is the Corinthian messenger, does not have a name in Sophocles' Oedipus
- Each act has a core, pay attention to the big picture

#### Act 1

- This Oedipus is fearful, feels guilty that he will fulfill the prophecy

#### Act 2 

- what matters is the sacrifice and the inspection of the entrails by Manto

#### Act 3

- summoning of the dead father

#### Act 4

- 

#### Act 5

- importance of faith 

#### Epilogue

- Oedipus gouged his eyes out first
- Reflection of Nero
  - Oedipus kills Jocasta
- the punishment at the end is also guilt from having killed his mother
- he is so rotten that you cannot pile up enough punishments for him

#### Themes

####  Instability and False Allure of Power

- power seduces us, causes us to overdo it
- violation of logos, end up behaving or acting unnatural, so you pay

#### Guilt

- contaminated by Oedipus'/Nero's excessiveness

#### Fate

- God speaks to humans, what God says is heard by prophets, then you go to the oracle to find out about what God has said
  - never written, only spoken
- has to do with the idea of logos
  - if you do x you will suffer y
- nature comes with an idea of necessity
- fate is cyclical

#### *Sympatheia*

- sharing someones suffering
- nature participating in Oedipus' suffering
- when nature is perverted following Oedipus' perversion
- Oedipus does not fall into the parameters of the riddle
  - he is swollen footed
  - 3 to 2 to 3
- there is no sympathy between nature and Oedipus
  - stoic sympathy would be if you referred to Jocasta as 'mother nature'

#### Empowerment mechanisms of the Roman State Disintegrate under the impact of Oedipus' perversion:

- <u>haruspicy</u> -  divination by inspecting the entrails of animals
- sacrifice
- necromancy
  - *necros*  = "dead body", *manteia*  = "divination"
  - why would Seneca bring back the Father?
    - revive nature so that nature can take place of the abomination

#### Blinding 

- Nero killed his mother in real life
- important for her to die after his eyes are gouged out
-
