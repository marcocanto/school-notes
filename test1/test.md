- Address each part of the question
- don't give the wrong facts
- use examples

1. The ancient Greeks believed that one’s future was shaped by “fate” or destiny, the
   development of events as determined by the god(s) and beyond a person’s control. Since
   Sophocles’ Oedipus was ignorant of having committed parricide and incest, was he
   actually guilty of these crimes? Is he innocent because he committed these acts unknowingly,
   or is he guilty because guilt lies in the act of doing wrong, not in intending to do wrong?
   Give three reasons to prove his guilt or innocence.

   - Oedipus hasn't paid so the city is still suffering
   - answer question in terms of Greek concept of guilt and innocence, partial agency
   - Christian concept of guilt did not exist
   - greek concept of guilt does not take intention into account
     - becomes wrong when you are caught
     - he is guilty under this idea
   - not a puppet of fate he had actions that led to his 
   - guilty of innocence and lacko of interest in the truth

2. Define fate and sympatheia (make sure to mention the etymological derivations of the two
   words) and give one example of the use of fate and one example of the use of sympatheia in
   Seneca’s Oedipus.

   - explain how fate is different from sympathiea

3. Oedipus and Creon as leaders in Sophocles’ plays. How do their **“tragic flaws”**
   compare? How do the flaws of both rulers affect their leadership? Remembering that these
   plays shaped social discussions in Sophocles’ time, formulate two thesis that state **(1) which
   qualities are praiseworthy in a ruler and why; and (2) which are not praiseworthy and why.**

   - as many qualities as you want, but must address both sides

   Oedipus

   - Oedipus is suspicious of people around him
   - thinks he knows everything
   - good at solving puzzles
   - judgmental and punishment oriented

   Creon

   - also suspicious, accused people of trying to swindle him (1034)
   - goes against the peoples wishes wanting him not to execute Antigone
   - punishment oriented
   - Devoted to the state / unconcerned with family
   - many inconsistencies, does not always follow through

4. Consider Antigone, Ismene, Creon, and Haemon, and what happens to them and their
   relationships. What is the role of family ties in Antigone? Which appears to be more
   important to Sophocles—family or civic authority? Why? Be sure to use evidence from the
   text to back up your arguments.

   - 

   Family

   - Orthodox
   - ISmene changes her mind and wants to support antigone
   - Creon changes his mind about killing her

   Civic Authority

   - protects the integrity of the city
   - Hegelian
     - authority of the state conflicts with the authority of family and ethnic views

   Role

   - family are antithesis of political states
     - synthesis is a democracy
