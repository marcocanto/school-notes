### Question 1

In Euripides’ *Medea,* the eponymous character delivers a monologue prior to killing her sons in which she momentarily considers sparing them. Give **two** reasons why Medea ultimately reverts to her original plan to kill them.

1. she wants to preserve her honor
2. Jason doesn't love them
   1. doesn't ask creon to let them stay

### Question 2

In his film *Medea*, one of the ways in which Lars von Trier depicts Medea is as a martyr. Give **two** arguments in favor of this view, one argument from plot and one from cinematic means (camera angles, visuals, sound, etc.).

- shots from the movie in cross position, symbolism in this shot, angled above her to show the position
  - lots of cross imagery
  - her carrying her children on a sled
    - shows the passion/suffering of Medea
- visual quote passion of Joan of arc
  - close up low angle shots
- when hanging her oldest son
  - cinematic close up shows the struggle of holding him up
  - waits til she feels she ca't physically as to feel like it is not voluntary
- cinematic scene of her suffering while dragging them up the hill
- lines that were changed for plot differnces
  - monologues where she was very mad at Jason
  - more level-headed considering her situation

### Question 3

In Euripides’ *Hippolytus*, Phaedra falsely accuses Hippolytus of rape. Give two reasons for which the accusation of rape may be deemed appropriate to the story. Be very precise about **how and why** rape may be thought of as the crime that Hippolytus commits.

- he doesn't respect aphrodite
- conceptual violence to women
  - taking them out of procreation
  - about taking women's consent away
  - somewhat misogynistic
  - considers them extraeneous
- feels ashamed, doesn't want anyone to think that he is like his father
  - makes it more appropriate that Phaedra accuses him of rape
- the rape is a punishment that fits the crime
  - reverses the situation
- in both stories his family plays a big role in his perception
  - difference of weapons shows how she will not give up on the love for her stepson

### Question 4

In Seneca’s Phaedra, Phaedra’s death is first theatricalized/staged and then brought about. Describe these two events (what happens in each) and explain their contribution to the play (i.e. say what this “double take” on Phaedra’s death aims to achieve.

#### General Notes

- noticeable difference between the monologue before she killed her children
- in the play she is informed by a messenger about how Creon and Glauce died, she wanted to know more about the way she died
- yelling at him when she is knocked down at the beach in the play
  - berates him, verbal alltercation
- take note of her reaction when she hangs her children in the play v movie
  - sacrificing in the movie, like a martyr would
- for plot think about the changes between the movie and the play
- Is Hippolytus a bad guy?
  - Bad
    - doesn't fit the role of a greek man who's role is to procreate
    - somewhat misogynistic - "if only we could procreate without women"
    - narcissist - "if only i can find another me"
  - Good
- Artemis said that she will get revenge by killing the next human Aphrodite falls in love with
  - humans suffer at the quarrels of the Gods
- 

### Unknown Essay

- In Euripides the evidence is the written tablet
- In Seneca the evidence is a sword
- In neither play a crime is committed
- written word vs. material object
- in both cases it is enough evidence
