## Euripides, Hippolytus

- Hippolytus does not want to have sex
- Phaedra is the opposite of Hippolytus
- What is wrong with Hippolytus' decision to abstain?
  - the Greeks had Gods that oversaw sex, and its opposite, chastity
    - Aphrodite Goddess of lust
    - Artemis, Goddess of chastity
  - by refusing to have sex he does not worship Aphrodite
- Hippolytus and Phaedra are representing the Gods Aphrodite and Hera
- the gods are controlling the action
  - shown by them being present at the beginning and end
- framing device: *deu ex machina* 
  - doesn't share the same space with anyone else
  - 'cheap' framing device
- Hippolytus 
  - *hippos* means loose
  - chastity in excess, doesn't want to have sex at all
  - his mother is Hippolyta, the queen of the amazon
  - the bastard son  of Theseus
- Phaedra 
  - name the shining one
- even though Hippolytus is a marginal character he needs to have sex like everyone else
- Theseus' father is Poseidon
  - when Theseus finds out about Hippolytus 'rape' he asks his father to kill his son
- Is there any freedom here, or is it a ll a script?
- the fact that the Gods are speaking in the prologue and epilogue indicates that they are in control
  - both are usually written by the author
- anything in excess is a sin
  - lust vs. chastity
- Is there any truth in what Phaedra says?
  - rape can be used metaphorically
  - being chaste towards someone who loves you
- Hippolytus needs to be taught a lesson after what he says about women 
  - cannot teach him, so this justifies his death
