#### Shame vs. Guilt

- shame is societal/social, where others view you negatively
  - you may not have done anything wrong
- guilt has an emphasis on deeds, what you have done
  - how what you have done lies within your morals
- she is 'bad'
  - no wrongdoing yet
  - she has lost her honor, so she is worthless
- shame is what shapes the human honor
  - what society thinks about you, your honor, is important
    - e.g. the best warrior gets the most money
      - the money is an external signal of his worth
- in the Greek world the emphasis is on shame
- guilt presupposes the execution/happening of a bad deed
- in the Roman world the emphasis is on guilt

#### Hippolytus vs. Phaedra

- the way that she lies is different

#### Principles of Stoicism

- *apatheia* - freedom from the passions
  - emotional moderation/restraint
- *logos* - life in accordance with reason
  - speech and reason are correlated
- *fate* - causal determinism
  - things are interconnected
  - past effects the present, present effects future

#### Progression of the Play

##### Act One: 

- the lines are 
- it is in my genes to fall in love outside or wedlock
  - call back to her mother Paciphae who mated with a bull

##### Act Two:

- actually meet, can see how they justify to each other
- 'rehearsal' of the rape
- she thinks that Theseus will not come back from the underworld
- when she lets her hair down she pretends to be Hippoltyus' mother (Hippolyta)
- goes to him to show her passion
- he's in a position to comfort her, her being a widowed wife
- Pheadra looks like his mother, while he acts like his father (Theseus)
  - they pretend to be others when they meet eachother
  - one wants to express love, the other wants to soothe
- theatric act, playing as others
- confesses to Hippolytus that she loves him, bc he reminds her of Theseus
  - admitting that she loves Hippolytus would make her guilty
  - treats him as a hybrid, representing both himself and his father
- she is begging him to kill her
  - rejects her, telling him to leave

##### Act Three:

- Theseus returns from the Underworld
- Phaedra falsely incriminates Hippolytus
- Theseus curses Hippolytus.

##### Act Four:

- Hippolytus is dead
- Theseus is remorseful

##### Act Five:

- Tells Theseus that he did not rape her
- Phaedra commits suicide out of guilt
  - uses the sword that Hippolytus threw

#### The Play

- the killing is theatrical
- two versions of Phaedra's death
  - theatrical version
    - threatens a 'deed'
    - when she asks to be killed she is asking for him to have sex with her
    - the desire is out, she is begging for it
  - the weapon is given to Theseus as evidence
    - Theseus curses his son and he dies
    - Phaedra sees the crime which establishes her guilt again
- sex and death are symbolically linked
- Hippolytus is a product of rape
  - Theseus and Hippolyta
  - in Theseus' life sex and murder are conjoined
  - because of fate people think that he can become a rapist
  - ashamed of his family
- If people don't know what you've done they will not shame you
  - thus the rehearsal
  - it works because he thinks that he has done something wrong when Phaedra confesses her love
  - 

##### Rehearsal (700)

- it is first rehearsed, then executed

- both Hippolytus and Phaedra appear as someone else

- she is his 'mother' so he will love her in a motherly way

- Phaedra passionate, Hippolytus non-passionate
  
  - no middle ground
  
- the crime is not committed here, it is enacted/rehearsed
  
  - she begs to be stabbed
  
- Her guilt is established here

- by rehearsing the scene it is as if he rapes her
  
- sword is a phallic symbol
  
- the 'deed' done in Seneca is fake

- they both feel ashamed in that moment

  - him for his family history, being seen as his rapist/murderer father
  - her for admitting her love to her stepson

- she could acknowledge her guilt, but is instead holding on to her honor

  - blaming 
  - the idea of shame stems from this
  - all the drama in the story stems from this

##### 1. Natural vs. Unnatural

##### 2. Family and Sex

##### 3. *Furor* vs. *Ratio*; No Gods

- **(The human soul as the battleground of an internal, civil war)**
