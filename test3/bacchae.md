## Euripides, *Bacchae*

- he is a stranger/ass-on to the system 
- he is creating a lot of mess
- Mother is a mortal woman, his father is Zeus
- Pentheus is Dionysus' cousin
- Euripides makes Pentheus' repression his downfall
- Deus Ex Machina
  - the God from the machine
- He is not accepted in the beginning, but is at the  end
- What happens to people that don't belong?
- He is coming to the city to cause conflict

### Main Topics / Progression of the Play

- What happens to a god when he is not accepted as such?
  
  - unless your mother is a goddess, you are not a god
  
- Pentheus is accepted as a ruler, while Dionysus is not

- Mountain of Cytheron populated by women

- The city is populated by men
  - can not procreate
  - the men cannot rule over women
  
- if there are not enough actors they can wear different masks
  - women cannot be actors, men play women's roles
  - the mask in Dionysus' case allows him to disguise himself among the mortals
  
- Dionysus is not very manly/male, pale, blonde haired, feminine

- Semele's sisters slandered semele

- **the slander is that she lied that she slept with Zeus** 

- Dionysus punishes every woman in Thebes

- Dionysus presents himself as a alternate kings

- The women are crazy

- Madness in the play is of two kinds
  - One is a disease/mental illness
    - women of Thebes are affected by this madness
    - this madness is a punishment for the slander
    - driven crazy by Dionysus as a punishment
  - Another kind that is not an illness
    - those who willingly embrace the God
    - Asian maenads
    - have made room in their souls for excess
  
- too much reason is bad

- people in thebes do not accept him bc he admits his mother is a human

  - resist the idea that a god can come from a human

- line (88-100)

- dionysus is the son of zeus squared

  - practically there is no semele
  - was raised in his thigh as a womb
  - Semele was just used for the conception

- Two political leaders of thebes

  - they do not actually believe in Dionysus
  - Cadmus and Tiresias
  - try to persuade Pentheus to believe in the God
    - hypocritical religious belief
  - Cadmus pays the price and is punished at the end

- line 286

  - if TIresias is going to tell him the story it is proof that he does not believe
  - took a fragment of 'aether' and made a dummy dionysus
    - people **misheard** the word and said that he 'sewed'  instead of 'showed'
    - people cannot imagine that a fetus came out of Zeus' thigh
      - tries to give Pentheus a rational explanation
  - paretymology - a false etymology


violence of the Bacchae

- sparagmos
  - hunt down the animal, tear them apart, then eat them
- omophagy
  - the eating of raw meat

Dionysus is using vision the most rational of senses to seduce Pentheus to his own cause

- puts him on top of the tree so now both could see each other, the gaze is reciprocated
  - when the Maenads see an outsider they will attack
  - they try to tear his body apart
  - at the end of the scene Pentheus is in pieces
