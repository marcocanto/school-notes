### Main Topics/Progression of the Play

- What happens to a god when he is not accepted as such?
  - unless your mother is a goddess, you are not a god
- Pentheus is accepted as a ruler, while Dionysus is not
- Mountain of Cytheron populated by women
- The city is populated by men
  - can not procreate
  - the men cannot rule over women
- if there are not enough actors they can wear different masks
  - women cannot be actors, men play women's roles
  - the mask in Dionysus' case allows him to disguise himself among the mortals
- Dionysus is not very manly/male, pale, blonde haired, feminine
- Semele's sisters slandered semele
- **the slander is that she lied that she slept with Zeus** 
- Dionysus punishes every woman in Thebes
- Dionysus presents himself as a alternate kings
- The women are crazy
- Madness in the play is of two kinds
  - One is a disease/mental illness
    - women of Thebes are affected by this madness
    - this madness is a punishment for the slander
    - driven crazy by Dionysus as a punishment
  - Another kind that is not an illness
    - those who willingly embrace the God
    - Asian maenads
    - have made room in their souls for excess
- too much reason is bad
