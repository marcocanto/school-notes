### Question 1

Identify two themes that Euripides&#39; Bacchae and Hallström&#39;s Chocolat have in common.
Illustrate each theme with one example from the play and one example from the film.

### Question 2

What is the official version of Dionysus’ birth and who gives it? What is Tiresias’ version
of it, and how does it show that he does not believe in Dionysus’ divinity?

### Question 3

Describe two ways in which Vianne’s chocolaterie may be seen as a “church” that
competes with the church of the village.

### Question 4

In the prologue of the Bacchae, Dionysus says that he wants to *prove* to Pentheus and
“every man in Thebes” that he is god (48). In what sense are his actions in the play proof of
his divinity?

- when he says he is going to prove his divinity, he will do so
- he proves by making the women of Thebes go insane
  - shows his power, goes along with his divinity
  - he applies the "proof" to men
    - men are supposed to be rational, where rational people need proof
- There is nothing in the play that he cannot control
- The ability to perform miracles is proof
  - miracles occur on in the city
  - earthquake
- Dionysus is mortal on stage
  
  - the god performs the miracle, 
- One of the most important proofs
  - Tampers with Pentheus' curiosity and is able to change his mind
  - the ability to bend one's will by tapping in to their desire to see/understand things
